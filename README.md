# furb-projects

This repository lists a few of the projects I worked on, and annotations I made, during my studies at the University ([Universidade Regional de Blumenau](http://www.furb.br), Blumenau - SC, Brazil).

These projects and files were retrieved from different sources (old hard drives, e-mails and so on).
